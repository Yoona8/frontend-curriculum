- add good text to links (not just "click here" or "show more")
- add alt to image with important information
- use the full name and (abbreviation) in brackets on first occurrence, if the abbreviation is less known
- `a[aria-disabled="true"]` not good to disable a link, but sometimes needed (hint to use a CSS selector)
- `output.value = ''` accessible in JS for `<output>`

-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; scroll native to iPhone (not sure, read more)
for blocks, which could be empty, add :empty { display: none; }
will-change for animations, but don't use often
<link rel="prefetch"> if needed
