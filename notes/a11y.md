<summary>Links</summary>

- add good text to links (not just "click here" or "show more")
- `a[aria-disabled="true"]` not good to disable a link, but sometimes needed (hint to use a CSS selector)

<details>
<summary>Why is it better not to disable buttons and what should you do instead?</summary>

- in general it is inaccessible
  - fool users into clicking
  - hard to see (grey on grey)
  - don't give any feedback (useless and irritating)
- just leave the buttons clickable and add a good error handling strategy, tell the user what's wrong!
