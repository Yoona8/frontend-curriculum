<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

- use the full name and (abbreviation) in brackets on first occurrence, if the abbreviation is less known

</details>

## Interactive elements
<details>
<summary>Links</summary>

- add good text to links (not just "click here" or "show more")
- `a[aria-disabled="true"]` not good to disable a link, but sometimes needed (hint to use a CSS selector)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is it better not to disable buttons and what should you do instead?</summary>

- in general it is inaccessible
  - fool users into clicking
  - hard to see (grey on grey)
  - don't give any feedback (useless and irritating)
- just leave the buttons clickable and add a good error handling strategy, tell the user what's wrong!

<summary>How to style forms?</summary>

- place labels above the field
- between labels and field place the hint
- make fields with borders, empty, easy to tap (44px minimum)
- make the width according to the suggested input length
- avoid multi columns
- don't validate as the user types, validate on submit
- put the list of errors on top and add focus field on clicked error (for group like radio, set focus on first)
- put the error message above the field too (below is problematic)
- use `autocapitalize="none"`, `autocorrect="off"`, `spellcheck="false"` on fields that expect grammatically incorrect data (ex: email, password)
- prefer radio over selects
