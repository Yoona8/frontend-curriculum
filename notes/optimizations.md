# Optimizations

## Startup time
<details>
<summary>General info</summary>

- Browser side (server code is already loaded)
- How long does it takes to see the content on the screen?
- How long does it takes till the user is able to interact with the website?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What to optimize?</summary>

- bundle size
- number of http requests

## Runtime performance
<details>
<summary>General info</summary>

- Both browser and server
- How smooth does the app run? (Freezes or lags?)
- How smooth do the animations play? (Visual lags?)
- Are there any memory leaks? (Is the page getting slower?)

</details>

<details>
<summary>What to optimize?</summary>

- code execution, DOM access (avoid unnecessary code execution, DOM interactions, repaints)
- memory leaks (slows down the app)
- find better code alternatives (ex: other method for iteration)
- micro-optimizations (very specific use-case, ex: data structures for frequent access or changes)

</details>

## Mobile UI
<details>
<summary>Random things</summary>

- `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` scroll native to iPhone (not sure, read more)

</details>

## Content

</details>

## CSS
<details>
<summary>Sometimes empty blocks</summary>

- for blocks, which could be empty, add `:empty { display: none; }`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Animations</summary>

- `will-change` for animations, but don't use often

</details>

## Load optimizations
<details>
<summary>Link tag</summary>

- `<link rel="prefetch">` if needed

</details>

## Server side
<details>
<summary>Compression of assets</summary>

- zipping static assets (CSS, JS, images) before serving
- browsers know how to unzip such files and will automatically do it
- less data is sent from server => faster load time
- on Firebase, static assets are automatically compressed
- sometimes you have to configure it manually

</details>

<details>
<summary>Caching (both frontend and server)</summary>

- saving data or files for re-use
- can be done on different levels
- browser automatically caches files (e.g. JS files) based on the caching headers set by the serving host
- controlling headers on the server-side config allows you to control how browsers will cache files
- helps to avoid unnecessary data transfer
- make sure to deliver updates properly
- server-side caching is all about storing data you work with on the server (e.g. fetched from a database) such that multiple requests requesting the same data can get that cached data

</details>

<details>
<summary>HTTP/2.0</summary>

- latest version of the HTTP protocol
- unlike HTTP/1 allows "server push" (servers can push required assets actively to a client instead of waiting for the client to request them)
