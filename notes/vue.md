# Vue
## Overall
<details>
<summary>Why should you choose Vue?</summary>

- if you want to learn faster (choose React or Vue instead of Angular)
- if your project is going to develop gradually in many steps, extending the functionality (choose React or Vue due to the best compatibility)
- when state becomes difficult to handle with vanilla JavaScript
- focus on logic and not on preventing your application from exploding
- huge ecosystem, community, high performance, development
- easy to use with multi page applications for widgets
- easy to rewrite legacy into vue
- works with a copy of DOM (compares to the actual DOM, renders only the changed parts, less traffic used, good for mobile device)
